var finaltext = "<p>A is the correct answer! These futuristic-looking buildings are the Petronas Towers, completed  in 1997 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They are the tallest buildings in the world. The Towers soar an amazing 1,483 feet (452 meters). By comparison, the Empire State Building, a New York City landmark, stands 1,250 feet (381 meters) tall.</p><p>The twin towers are built on 380-foot (115-meter)-deep piles and are joined by a pedestrian skybridge at the 41st and 42nd floors. The 88-story buildings are considered a symbol of Malaysia's economic growth while at the same time clearly recognizing the country's Islamic traditions by incorporating a star-shaped floor plan.</p><p>The entire structure has 4.6 million square feet (427,500 square meters) of floor space and includes a 1.5-million-square-foot (140,000-square-meter) shopping and entertainment center, an 850-seat concert hall, parking for 5,000 cars, and two smaller towers with 2 million square feet (186,000 square meters) of office space.
