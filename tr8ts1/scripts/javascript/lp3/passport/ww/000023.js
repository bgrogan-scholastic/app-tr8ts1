var finaltext = "<p>B is the correct answer! Yosemite Valley, part of Yosemite National Park in California, is a flat-floored, glacially gouged valley about 7 miles (11 kilometers) long and less than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) wide. On its floor, the Merced River meanders placidly through meadows and groves of trees. On either side of the valley, magnificent granite walls rise almost perpendicularly 2,500 to 3,500 feet (760 to 1,070 meters). Yosemite Falls, on the north side of the valley, drops 2,610 feet (796 meters) in three stages and is the longest falls in North America.</p><p>Yosemite Valley was discovered in 1851 when Major James D. Savage, leading a battalion in pursuit of a band of Indians who had been raiding mining camps, traced them to the valley, which was their home. The Indians were of the Miwok tribe, but were called the Yosemite (Miwok for \"grizzly bear\"). As early as 1855, visitors began to arrive in the valley, and their descriptions of its magnificence attracted an increasing number of tourists--despite the rugged trip.</p><p>To preserve the beauty of Yosemite, Congress in 1864 made a special grant of 48.6 square miles (126 square kilometers) of the area to California for a state park. In 1890, Yosemite National Park was established. (Mark Lewis/Gamma Liaison)</p>";
