var finaltext = "<p>About a million years ago, a huge volcano rose out of the ocean to form what is now the eastern half of Maui, one of the Hawaiian islands. Named Haleakala, \"House of the Sun,\" by the ancient Hawaiians, the volcano has not erupted since the late 18th century. But rumbling still occurs deep within its core--a warning that the sleeping giant might awaken again.</p><p>Haleakala rises 25,000 ft. (7,600 m.) from the ocean floor, but only 10,000 ft. (3,000 m.) are above sea level. At the top is a 19-sq.-mi. (49-sq.-km.) domed crater, which has been called \"a moonscape on Earth.\" The surface of the huge bowl is pocked with smaller craters and studded with cinder cones and lava sculptures. Grains of iron-oxide lava give the cones their sparkling colors, which can change from dull gray to bright orange, depending on the light.</p><p>Visitors to Haleakala National Park can travel on foot or horseback across the crater. The western slope of Haleakala is arid, but the eastern side receives a whopping 250 in. (6,350 mm.) of rain each year. A lush rain forest is home to an astonishing variety of birds. It extends from the rim to the shore. Vacationers can bathe in numerous pools along the Oheo Stream, which tumbles to the sea in a series of waterfalls and white-water cascades.
