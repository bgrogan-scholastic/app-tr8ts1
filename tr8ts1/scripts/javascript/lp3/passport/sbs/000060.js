var text="<p>Congratulations!</p>Taj Mahal is correct! This beautiful mausoleum of white marble is located on the outskirts of Agra, India. It derives its name from Mum<I>taz Mahall</I>l (Ornament of the Palace), the title given to the favorite wife of the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal to house the remains of his wife, who died in 1631.</p><p>Originally the emperor intended to build a replica of the Taj Mahal in black marble for his own burial. It was to be connected with the Taj Mahal by a bridge. Before Shah Jahan could realize this ambition, however, he was deposed. (Brian Vikander/Corbis)</p>";
