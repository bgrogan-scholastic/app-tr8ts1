phpLDAPadmin roadmap

0.9.3 planned features:
	Bugfix release.
	This release will focus on fixing bugs, adding minor features, and improving stability.
	Samba 3.0 support in samba user and machine creation templates
	Move template config to a new config file: template_config.php (or something)

0.9.4 planned features:
	* Complete i18n. All strings localized.
    Modification templates:
		* gropOfNames (view full DNs and browse buttons)
		* groupOfUniqueNames (view full DNs and browse buttons)
	* http auth_type (a la phpMyAdmin)
	* read-only attributes (similar to hidden attributes) in config
	* Default mod template: Add a "browse" button for attributes that store DNs.
		caveat: We don't have a way to reference form elements with "[]" in the name, causing a proble
		with our default mod template. The "browser" button is present, but cannot populate the form
		element.
	* Add output buffering when including lang files so no output is sent to the browser (which could cause problems for sessions and cookies)
	* Paging search results.
	* Anonymous binds redirect to search page with no tree viewer (as an option in config)
    * pretty-printed DNs
    * DSML exports
    * obfuscated password display
    * more linkage in the schema browser (used by links)
    * jpegs drawn in-line in searches
    * configurable read-only attributes
    * paging in search results (ie, viewing entries 1-50 of 436)
	* Configuration for templates.

0.9.5 planned features:
    Maybe create a class called Config with static functions for fetching configuration data (ie, Config::isServerReadOnly()).
        or: Object-oriented server and general configuration (ie, add a class Server)
	Support and test ActiveDirectory and iMail LDAP schema.
    Add link to objectClass values in default mod template to jump to that objectClass in the schema viewer.
    Make deref param modifiable in the advanced search form (LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS, LDAP_DEREF_NEVER, etc.)
    Better handling of aliases and referals (display the actual alias with aliasedObjectName or ref attrs, and don't follow or perhaps make it configurable like ldapsearch)
	Remove all HTML from language files.
	Add a random hint on the welcome page
	Add blowfish encryption to encrypt cookie-stored passwords and DNs.
	Support for modifying replica entries (using ldap_set_rebind_proc())
	Modification templates 
		user
		oragnizationalUnit
		sambaUser (v 2 and 3)
		sambaMachine
	Search filter builder for simple search form (just select AND or OR for a group of criteria)
	Add mass-update feature (user provides filter and set of attrs/vals to modify)
	No-schema mode of operation (some servers simply won't give us schema. This becomes a problem for normal operation)
    i18n localization of all creation templates
	Hidden/read-only attrs on a filter-basis (ie, different users have different viewable, writable	attributes)
	Serious compatibility testing for additional LDAP servers.

(* means an item is complete and checed into CVS)
