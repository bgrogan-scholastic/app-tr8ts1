    * OpenBSD with chroot'ed Apache:

       For jpeg photos to work properly, you must do this:
       # mkdir /var/www/tmp, and then
       # chown root:daemon /var/www/tmp
       # chmod 1755 /var/www/tmp
       Where tmp is the $jpeg_temp_dir configured in config.php

    * Windows 

       For jpeg photos to work properly, be sure to change $jpeg_temp_dir
       from "/tmp" to "c:\\temp" or similar.
