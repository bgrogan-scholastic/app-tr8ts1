1.    By: MacNeil, John S.,  &quot;DNA Tweezers, Please.&quot; <i> Science Now</i>   , 8/11/2003, p1</font></a><br>
<p> 
 Abstract:  DNA has the ability to store the very blueprint of life. A report in the 'Nature,' describes how strands of DNA can be programmed to cyclically open and close, creating a minuscule device that can do mechanical work. DNA has been recruited for new tasks at the molecular level. Some researchers have manipulated DNA strands to carry out computations. DNA can also help build a whole new generation of components, such as integrated circuits and switches.

2.    By: Jensen, Mari N.,  &quot;Rockies' Rodents Sleep In.&quot; <i> Science Now</i>   , 8/11/2003, p1</font></a><br>
<p> 
 Abstract:  A study shows that chipmunks and ground squirrels in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado are hibernating much longer than they did a quarter-century ago. Researchers think that their long hibernation may reflect a changing climate. These species take cue about a changing climate from various environmental sources. The study shows that global warming might cause organisms to become disconnected in some way from their resources — the plants come out on their own schedule, and the animals come out on a different schedule.

3.    By: Vogel, Gretchen,  &quot;Flicking the Fat Switch.&quot; <i> Science Now</i>   , 8/11/2003, p2</font></a><br>
<p> 
 Abstract:  Scientists have found a molecular switch that can control the development of fat cells. The molecule, called Wnt 10b, isone of a large family of proteins that helps direct the fate ofcells. Scientists hope it may clarify the complex processes in the human body that control the formation of new adipocytes — cells that store energy as fat. If scientists could somehow use the Wnt protein to promote muscle development and discourage fat cells, it might eventually be useful for treating obese patients who have more fat cells than normal.

4.    By: Holden, Constance,  &quot;Fighting Cancer at the Keyboard.&quot; <i> Science Now</i>   , 8/11/2003, p3</font></a><br>
<p> 
 Abstract:  Medical research is getting into the distributed computing act. In May 2003, Parabon Computation Inc., a firm based in Fairfax, Virginia, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute invited PC users to 'Compute Against Cancer.' About 5000 people have signed up to help analyze data on how various anticancer drugs affect gene expression in cells. Parabon breaks up large computational problems into smaller tasks and sends them out to computers that have downloaded the proper software. Processing goes on while the computer is idle, and results are sent back to the company's server.

7.    By: Braunschvig, David; Garwin, Richard L.; Marwell, Jeremy C.,  &quot;Space Diplomacy.&quot; <i> Foreign Affairs</i>   , Jul/Aug2003, Vol. 82 Issue 4,  p156</font></a><br>
<p> 
 Abstract:  This article describes the Global Positioning System (GPS) developed by the United States Department of Defense and the Galileo European satellite navigation system proposed by the European Union. The European proposal has sparked a serious transatlantic argument, including the issue of potential interference between GPS and Galileo. The debate centers on the effectiveness of a critical U.S. military asset against the right of the European Union to rely on a system that is independent of U.S. control. GPS has military and commercial applications. GPS provides positioning and navigation information to recreational boaters and hikers. Cellular telephones, the Internet, digital cryptography and international financial transactions all depend on GPS-based timing information. GPS are also used to improve the navigation of military aircraft and ships. The European Union has pitched Galileo as a civilian and commercial system. Galileo's sponsors promise more robustness, greater continuity, and broader coverage than the GPS. When complete, Galileo will provide five primary positioning services: free access for most consumer-related applications; a fee-based service for applications requiring more precision; an open service for life-safety applications; a search-and-rescue service for emergency operations; and a public regulated service for certain security-oriented applications.
