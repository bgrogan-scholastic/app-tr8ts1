var text="<p>Congratulations!</p><p>The statue of Christ the Redeemer is located in Rio de Janeiro, which is a major port and one of South America's largest cities. At the top of Corcovado Mountain, the statue-one of Rio's most visited attractions-stands 100 ft. (30 m.) high and depicts Christ blessing the city with open arms. At its base there is a chapel large enough to accommodate 150 people. Visitors to the statue are offered breathtaking 360-degree views of Rio, with the surrounding Tijuca National Park spreading out below and magnificent mountains and Guanabara Bay providing a dramatic backdrop.
