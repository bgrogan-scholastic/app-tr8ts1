var text="<p>Congratulations!</p><p>Marrakesh, located in the northern foothills of the High Atlas Mountains, dates back to 1062. The Medina, or old city, has narrow, irregular streets with crowded residences, small shops, and mosques. Near the center of the Medina, an open square-the Place Djemaa-el-Fna (above)-is devoted to commerce during the mornings, accommodating vendors of bread, produce, baskets, and sweets. Toward evening, the square becomes an entertainment center, with circles of spectators surrounding storytellers, snake charmers, dancers, and acrobats. Nearby workshops produce brasswear, jewelry, carpets, leather goods, and pottery. The tower of the Kutubia Mosque (top of photo) dominates the Medina. (© GoodShoot/Superstock)</p>";
