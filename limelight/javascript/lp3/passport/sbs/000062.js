var text="<p>Congratulations!</p><p>Located in the Mexican state of Guerrero and backed by steep, green mountains, the sandy beaches and year-round warm climate of Acapulco draw throngs of vacationers. The city was founded in the 1530s by the Spanish, and became a key link in the trade route between the Far East and Spain. In the early 1800s, trade declined and the port lost its importance. The region's modern development dates from the 1930s; today, Acapulco is a renowned resort area offering such amenities as luxurious houses and fashionable hotels.
