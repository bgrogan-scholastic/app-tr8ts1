var finaltext = "<p>C is the correct answer! The tourists in the photograph above are viewing the Blue Grotto, a natural limestone cavern on the north shore of the Italian island of Capri, in the Bay of Naples. Accessible only by boat, the grotto is about 175 ft. (53 m.) long and 50 ft. (15 m.) high. Sunlight enters through the water and reflects a dazzling blue light inside.
