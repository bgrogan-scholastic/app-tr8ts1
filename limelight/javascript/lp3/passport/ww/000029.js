var finaltext = "<p>B is the correct answer! The huge Itaip&uacute; Dam, constructed jointly by Brazil and Paraguay on the Paran&aacute; River, is located on the Brazil-Paraguay border just north of Ciudad del Este (formerly Puerto Stroessner). The 5-mi. (8-km.)-long dam officially opened in 1982. The hydroelectric power station can generate 12,600 megawatts, making it the largest power complex on Earth. It provides most of Paraguay's electricity and power for industrialized southern Brazil. Construction costs for the dam reached $20 billion. (&copy; Douglas Engle/AP/Wide World Photos)</p>";
