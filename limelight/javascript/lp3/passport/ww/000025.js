var finaltext = "<p> A is the correct answer! This photograph is of the front door of the historic Alamo fort in San Antonio, Texas. The Alamo, the Spanish word for \"cottonwood,\" was built in 1718 as a Spanish mission. It is best known for the role it played in Texas' war for independence from Mexico.</p><p>On February 23, 1836, two months after hostilities had erupted between Texas and Mexico, some 2,000 Texans took refuge in the old mission building, hoping to defend the city of San Antonio against an approaching Mexican army of about 5,000 men. Using the Alamo as a fort, the Texans held off the Mexican army for 13 days. But on March 6, Mexican troops stormed the Alamo, and 187 defenders were killed, including Jim Bowie, the famous frontiersman Davy Crockett, and William Travis. From then on, \"Remember the Alamo\" became a rallying cry for Texans.</p><p>Today, the Alamo is Texas' most popular tourist attraction. More than 2.5 million people visit the site each year. Alamo Plaza is a 4.2-acre (1.7-ha.) complex located in downtown San Antonio. The plaza includes the Shrine and Long Barrack Museum. On display are exhibits covering not only the Texas Revolution but also more than 300 years of Texas history. (&copy; Jim Cummins/Taxi/Getty Images)</p>";
